# Data Science Notebook Structure & Common Packages

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository serves as a collection of my Data Science and Machine Learning projects. Here, you'll find well-structured Jupyter notebooks, machine learning workflows, and insights derived from various datasets. My goal is to create reproducible and scalable machine learning models while maintaining clean and efficient code.

## Notebook Structure
Each Jupyter notebook follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. Below is the typical structure I use:

### 1. Project Overview
   - Brief introduction to the project
   - Problem statement and objectives
   - Dataset source and description

### 2. Data Loading & Exploration
   - Import necessary libraries
   - Load datasets using `pandas`
   - Perform initial exploration (`.info()`, `.describe()`, missing values, etc.)
   - Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

### 3. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling and normalizing features
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets

### 4. Feature Engineering
   - Creating new features
   - Feature selection and extraction
   - Dimensionality reduction techniques

### 5. Model Training & Evaluation
   - Implementing various machine learning models
   - Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`
   - Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
   - Visualization of model performance

### 6. Results & Conclusion
   - Summary of findings
   - Comparison of different models
   - Insights and takeaways

### 7. Future Work
   - Potential improvements
   - Next steps for model enhancement
   - Deployment strategies

## Commonly Used Packages
In most of my projects, I utilize the following Python libraries:

### **Data Manipulation & Visualization**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### **Machine Learning Models**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier
```

### **Deep Learning**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
```

### **Experiment Tracking & Version Control**
```python
import mlflow
import dvc
```

### **Model Deployment**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import streamlit as st
import gradio as gr
```

### **Testing & Code Quality**
```python
import pytest
import black
import flake8
```
